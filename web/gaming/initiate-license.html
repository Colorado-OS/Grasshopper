    <h4>As a first step, we can see the applicant/player initiating the license application by sending an fee to an address provided by the state.</h4>
    <h4>This page/QR code could be served up remotely over the internet, or in person for added security.</h4>
    <h4>We envision the receiving address to be unique per applicant, and provided from an HD wallet for easy/secure address distribution/management. </h4>
    <h4>While this step could be seen as optional, it does provide an on-chain record of the applicant address which is important for step 2. Also, by requiring the application fee first we can ensure the applicant is serious about applying.</h4>
